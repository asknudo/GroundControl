<h1>Ground Control: A look into the NFL running game </h1>
<p>Ground Control is a project that was started by Forever-Peace. Data consists of every regular season rushing attempt by a Running Back from teh six years between 2010 and 2015. The data is drawn from the official NFL JSON feed, through the wonderful nfldb python package. ( https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki ) This should reflect the official scorekeeping of the NFL.</p>

<h2>App Descriptions</h2>

<h3>App #1: Player Distribution Plotter</h3>
<div><img src='http://i.imgur.com/QnH8ik8.png'></div>
<p>The purpose of this app is pretty simple: plot the run distribution for any running back of the past six years. You can sort alphabetically or by volume, collapse across years or look at individual years, and the app automatically produces two plots: the regular run distribution and the cumulative run distribution (see chapter 1). # of carries is listed at the bottom. The player you select is always in red, the league average is always in blue.

To get the app, make sure you have R and Rstudio (described in the OP), then copy-paste the run command into the "console" window of RStudio. That's it! Let me know if you have any trouble.</p>


<h3>App #2: Player Comparison Machine</h3>
<div><img src='http://i.imgur.com/QnH8ik8.png'></div>
<p>The previous app let you compare a selected player to the average. This app lets you compare two players directly to one-another. You can also select one player, change the comparison type to "Years", and compare that player's performance from one year to the next.

To get the app, make sure you have R and Rstudio (described in the OP), then copy-paste the run command into the "console" window of RStudio. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>App #3: Player vs. Teammates</h3>
<div><img src='http://i.imgur.com/4ShuB68.png'></div>
<p>Essentially, it lets you compare a selected player to all of the other running backs on his team that took carries in the same games.

This is a little different from simply "comparing a player to all of his teammates", because it draws data on a week-by-week basis. So, for example, let's say Marshawn Lynch had to sit during a week that Rawls had a cakewalk opponent, or Randle got to run with Romo as a QB while McFadden had most of his carries under Matt Cassel. This approach should remove those potential sources of bias. It only compares like versus like: drawing from only the competing carries where both the player and his teammates had the same opponent, and probably the same QB and same offensive line composition.

It also lets us include players who jumped teams. Terrance West is only compared against TEN players for his first two games (regardless of what those TEN players did afterwards against different opponents), then is compared against BAL players for the rest of his games (regardless of what those BAL players did at the start of the season).

In essence, it lets us compare a player to his teammates while approximately controlling for game-level factors like opponent, offensive line, weather, QB etc.

This game-by-game approach also lets us introduce a new statistic: "Run Share". Usage rates, or the proportion of a team's carries a guy gets during a season, can be easily biased by injuries. "Run Share" calculates that proportion of carries a guy gets when he's active (or has at least 1 carry, rather).

Hope you enjoy! This one was a lot of work, bit I think it's pretty cool. - Forever-Peace</p>

<h3>App #4: Distribution Matching</h3>
<div><img src='http://i.imgur.com/5O4PNAs.png'></div>
<p>This app allows you to do the same sort of distribution matching that we utilized in chapter 3. Pick a player, and you will be given A) an ordered list of matches (best at the top to worst on the bottom) that you can choose from to plot against the player you ran through the matcher, and B) a text list of the top 10 matches. If you felt that 50 carries was too small of a sample size for matching, you can select higher cutoffs at the top right. This will remove any "matches" below that limit.</p>

<h3>App #5: Head to Head competitions</h3>
<div><img src='http://i.imgur.com/5hdYvPN.png'></div>
<p>Pick two players, pick a sample size (i.e. the number of carries you want them to take in their competition), and hit "Run", and it will calculate the proportion of the time (out of 10,000 competitions) that each player will "win" the competition (IE have the most yards / highest yards per carry). It uses actual NFL runs from each player, chosen at random. The plot shows the possible distributions of yards per carry for each player given that sample size (so, for example, if each player only takes 10 carries, maybe even Adrian Peterson can average as low as 1YPC or so every now and then, and lose to Alfred Blue).

The second tab of the app shows you some information about the types of outcomes you can expect from each player, given the number of carries you selected.
